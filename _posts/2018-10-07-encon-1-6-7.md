Encon 1.6.7 has been released and is is now available from [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.appulse.encon%20AND%20v:1.6.7).

The main changes related to abandoning cached values (or simplify implementation) for Erlang terms. In the future release [distribution header](http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html#distribution_header) will be used for atoms caching.

### Changed

- `ErlangInteger.cached` now has `java.lang.Integer`-like cache strategy.

### Removed

- `ErlangAtom.cached` methods;
- `ErlangPid.cached` method.
