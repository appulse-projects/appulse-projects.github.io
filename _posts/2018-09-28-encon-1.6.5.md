Encon 1.6.5 has been released and is is now available from [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.appulse.encon%20AND%20v:1.6.5).

It is minor quick fix release, nothing fascinating.

### Changed

- Quick fix for [GitHub issue](https://github.com/appulse-projects/encon-java/issues/10), added `ATOM` and `SMALL_ATOM` serialization;
- Remove `LruCache` from `encon-common` and use the same class from `io.appulse:utils-java:1.10.0`.
