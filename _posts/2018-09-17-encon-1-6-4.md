Encon 1.6.4 has been released and is is now available from [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.appulse.encon%20AND%20v:1.6.4).

### Added

- `Mailbox.call()` and `Mailbox.receiveRemoteProcedureResult()`, a remote procedure call functionality;
- `Mailbox.exit()` without arguments, for normal mailbox exiting;
- Benchmark's `README.md` section about how to run single/group of becnhmark(s).

### Changed

- Tuned server and client `Netty`'s settings, especially its `WRITE_BUFFER_WATER_MARK` option;
- Now, use `channel.eventLoop().execute(Runnable)` for server's responses, instead of creating composite buffer and single `writeAndFlush` call;
- Fix samples `pom.xml` files.
