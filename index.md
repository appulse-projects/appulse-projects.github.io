`Appulse` is a set of projects aim to build correct concurrent and scalable applications on top of two the most popular and reliable technologies, in the enterprise world, `BEAM VM` and `JVM`.

The main project is the Encon. Encon is a Java library, **E**rlang **N**ode **CON**nector, which allows your `JVM` app to duplex interact with `Erlang` or `Elixir` nodes. It is based on [Erlang Distribution Protocol](http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_dist_protocol.html) and provides a convenient way to work with its components. The project consists of different sub-modules, start from basic elements like Erlang term serialization/deserialization, continue to Erlang distribution protocol itself and end with data mapping and Spring integration.

Moreover, `appulse` contains projects for helping and utility purposes, like Java `EPMD` implementation, utilities, and logging artifacts.
